## ArrayList
- first()
- last()
- firstKey()
- lastKey()
- differentValues()
- sameValues()

## Programmatic Principles
- Methods are CamcelCase
  - Therefore, all original snake-case functions are rewritten into CamcelCase Methods
- Method Paremters are lowercase and snake-case (following C, C++, and the PHP constant design)
- Methods will never return a NULL type
